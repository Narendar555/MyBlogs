Spring boot:
  
           It is a java frame work which is used to build web applications efficiently.

Dependency injunction:

Annotation:A type of symbol which nothing but a symbol '@'+name of annotation
           
           Annotation is mostly used to define that the method or class 
          
           performs for what? or how?.

Some types of annotations:

           @Controller-A type of annotation which is used to define that the servlet or java file that should be

                       Performed as controller.the main use of controller is to make that the requested view page
                   
                       To be visible on browser where we requested.
           
           @ResponseBody-is a type of annotation which is only used when we are return something which is not returning 

                         that the file format instead of that the method where we initialised it and the method can only
      
                         String or any other data types value except files like .jsp etc..

           @RequestMapping()-is a type of annotation which is used to map that the method where it initialised and returns 

                            what that the method actually return.In between of that braces the request name or view name 

                            to be placed then only it is ease for mapping the correct jsp file for the corresponding request.

Jaser jar file(tomcat jaser):
       It is a type of jar file which is used to make that the jsp file to be visible on the browser by adding it's dependency 

       on pom.xml file.so whenever we want to display our jsp file for incoming request we need to add the dependency of jaser 

       jar file on pom.xml.

MVC-Model View Controller

Actual process:

    Client request->server->web container->searching for servlet or jsp having the request name,once it is found.->response to the client.

Controller=servlet=java file

*Controller can contains a lot of methods with unique request name.

Artifact- project name

Group id- package name

All the html or jsp files should be in src/main/webapp.

All the java or servlet should be in src-java-main/com.package.name.

Example Controller:(which is used return jsp file while the word called index is coming as a request)
       import...
       
       @Controller
       
       Public class NormalServletController{

            @RequestMapping("index")
  
            Public String index(){
     
                  return "index.jsp";

            }

        }

Now develop JSP:
       <html>

       <head>

       <title> welcome to softworks </title>

       </head>

       <body>

       //your html content to be here

       </body>

       </html>
